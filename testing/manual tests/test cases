Perkbox login test scenarios:

Account log in:

 Positive:
 1- Use valid user email: User should be redirected to page displaying available list of accounts.
 2- Select any account and click on `confirm`: User should be redirected to account login page, with email pre populated.
 2.1 - Click on Back arrow: User is sent to previous page.
 3- Click on confirm button: User should be redirected to related account.
 3.1 - Reloading page: User is sent back to first login page.


 Negative - first login form: 
 1- Use unregistered user email: User should be displayed with error message `User is not found`.
 2- Use malformed user email: User should be displayed with error message `This email address is not valid`.
 3- Inject JS code that executes any malicious action: User should be displayed with error message `This email address is not valid`.

 Negative - select account
 1- Don't select any account and click on `confirm`: Nothing happens (user should be able to see an error message here though)

Not part of login functionality, but present on the page:

1- Make sure any links available redirect to correct URL.
2- Make sure any buttons open up related pop ups (for example `Hi there` pop up)
3- All `X` (close) buttons close pop ups for example `Hi there` pop up)
